## Part A — How We Work: Agile at a Glance

**Slide Group: 2–3 slides**

### Content

1. **Epics, Stories, Subtasks** — Define the hierarchy used throughout the semester.
   - **Epic** = a major capability (e.g., "Job Posting", "Messaging").
   - **Story** = a user-visible feature within an epic (e.g., "As a user, I can post a job with a title, description, employer, location, and optional salary").
   - **Subtask** = an implementation or testing unit (e.g., "Implement salary validation", "Write test for blank description re-prompt").

2. **Rotating Scrum Master** — Every epic had a different Scrum Master. Show the rotation:

   | Epic | Scrum Master | Coder 1 | Coder 2 | Tester 1 | Tester 2 |
   |------|-------------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
   | 1 | Trevor | Aaron | Olga | Melaine | Victoria |
   | 2 | Melaine | Victoria | Trevor | Aaron | Olga |
   | 3 | Victoria | Trevor | Aaron | Olga | Melaine |
   | 4 | Trevor | Aaron | Olga | Melaine | Victoria |
   | 5 | Aaron | Olga | Melaine | Victoria | Trevor |
   | 6 | Olga | Melaine | Victoria | Trevor | Aaron |
   | 7 | Melaine | Victoria | Trevor | Aaron | Olga |
   | 8 | Victoria | Trevor | Aaron | Olga | Melaine |
   | 9 | *(entire team — final epic)* | | | | |

3. **Branching Strategy** — Feature branches per epic:
   - `impl/<feature>` for implementation
   - `test/<feature>` for test development
   - PRs merge test → impl → main
   - Example from Epic 5: `impl/connection_management`, `test/connection_management` → PR #18 → `main`

4. **How we tackled new features** — For each epic the coders would branch off `main`, implement features, while testers simultaneously wrote test fixtures on a parallel branch. Test branches merged into impl branches, impl branches merged into main via PR. CI ran on every push.

### Key Artifacts to Show
- The role rotation table above
- A screenshot or diagram of the branching model
- The PR merge pattern (test → impl → main)

## Part B — Building InCollege: A Chronological Story

This is the heart of the presentation. Each milestone tells what was built, cites the commits, and briefly touches on testing — but testing is NOT the focus of every milestone. Instead, test infrastructure improvements are called out as dedicated **Interludes** between milestones.

---

### Milestone 1: Project Bootstrap & Epic 1 — Authentication (Jan 21 – Jan 27)

**Slide Group: 2–3 slides**

#### What Was Built

The foundation of the entire application:
- **DevContainer & CI** — Dockerfile with GnuCOBOL, GitHub Actions build workflow
- **Core COBOL Program** (`src/main.cob`) — The monolithic starting point
- **Account Creation** — Username + password with validation rules:
  - 8–12 characters, at least 1 uppercase, 1 digit, 1 special character (`!@#$%^&*`)
- **Login** — Credential matching against `ACCOUNTS.DAT`, unlimited retry on failure
- **Account Limit** — Maximum 5 accounts enforced
- **Persistence** — `ACCOUNTS.DAT` file survives across program runs
- **Skills Menu** — Placeholder "Learn a New Skill" submenu
- **EOF Handling** — Graceful termination when input stream exhausts

#### Key Commits (chronological)

| Hash | Date | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `8d19aed` | Jan 21 | **Initial commit** — Dockerfile, devcontainer, build.yml, main.cob skeleton (8 files, 172 lines) |
| `f5dc321` | Jan 21 | Add Epic #1 deliverable PDF |
| `53c053a` | Jan 21 | Fix Ubuntu-related COBOL compiler issues for GH workflow |
| `5ba8fc9` | Jan 23 | **Add test infrastructure** — test_runner.py, fixtures, run_tests.sh (26 files, 1875 lines) |
| `b2f3763` | Jan 24 | **Epic #1 stories 1–4 implementation** — The core COBOL program by Viktoria (516 lines added to main.cob) |
| `59e8dea` | Jan 25 | **Refactor test runner for file-based I/O** — GH Actions CI, expected output files (52 files, 1179 insertions) |
| `23ea1d4` | Jan 26 | Password validation, menu text, infinite loop fix — all 18 tests pass |
| `4c1b395` | Jan 26 | **Merge PR #3** — Stable Epic #1 into main |
| `e8ad1db` | Jan 26 | **Merge PR #4** — EOF handling fixes |

#### How It Was Tested

This is where testing is introduced for the first time in the presentation:
- **18 test fixtures** covering: login success/failure, account creation, password validation, EOF at every menu point
- Tests are simple `.in.txt` / `.out.txt` file pairs — input is piped into the COBOL binary via `INPUT.TXT`, output compared line-by-line against expected `OUTPUT.TXT`
- The test runner (`test_runner.py`) was born here — a Python script that discovers fixtures, runs the binary, and diffs output

#### Architecture at This Point

```
src/main.cob          (~520 lines, monolithic)
ACCOUNTS.DAT          (persistent storage)
tests/test_runner.py  (basic runner)
tests/fixtures/       (18 test pairs)
```

---

### Milestone 2: Epic 2 — User Profiles (Feb 1)

**Slide Group: 1–2 slides**

#### What Was Built

- **Profile Creation** — Required fields: first name, last name, university, major, graduation year
- **Optional Fields** — About Me (max 200 chars), up to 3 work experiences, up to 3 education entries
- **Profile Viewing** — Display complete profile with all fields
- **Profile Editing** — Update existing profile data
- **Profile Persistence** — `PROFILES.DAT` file (fixed-width records, 1206 bytes each)
- **Graduation Year Validation** — Must be 4 digits, 1950–2050

#### Key Commits

| Hash | Date | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `9a2e4f8` | Jan 27 | Move epics to `/epics`, add Epic #2 PDF |
| `c7a84cb` | Feb 1 | **Major commit** — About Me, missing fields validation, profile CRUD (91 files, 4749 insertions). `main.cob` grows to ~1220 lines |
| `2c25938` | Feb 1 | Fix About Me to actually enforce 200-char max |
| `1b5225c` | Feb 1 | Update all 28 test fixtures for new education/experience prompts |
| `275594b` | Feb 1 | Increase OUTPUT-RECORD to 500 chars for long profile fields |

#### How It Was Tested (brief)
- Existing 18 tests updated for new menu structure
- New fixtures for: profile creation, editing, viewing, graduation year validation, long text, persistence across logins, special characters
- Still using basic `.in.txt` / `.out.txt` pairs — no macros yet

#### Architecture Growth

`main.cob` is now **~1220 lines** — still monolithic. Two `.DAT` files: `ACCOUNTS.DAT` + `PROFILES.DAT`.

---

**Slide Group: 1–2 slides**

#### What Was Built

- **Find Someone You Know** — Search for users by full name (first + last)

#### Testing Note
- 30+ new test fixtures: profile viewing (long text, blanks, persistence), search (found, not found, after edit, EOF)
- `AGENTS.md` added (621 lines) — documented project guidelines and COBOL standards for AI-assisted development
- `JIRA_TASK_MAPPING.md` added — maps test fixtures to JIRA stories

---

### Interlude A: The Test Runner (Jan 23 – Feb 19)

**Slide Group: 2–3 slides — THIS IS A MAJOR DIFFERENTIATOR**

> *"The tests were becoming hard to manage manually. So we built a real test runner."*

This interlude explains how the test infrastructure evolved from a simple script to a sophisticated system. It should be placed here because by Epic 3, the team had ~50+ test fixtures and the manual approach was hitting limits.

#### Phase 1: Birth (Jan 23) — `5ba8fc9`
- `test_runner.py` created — discovers test directories, runs COBOL binary, compares output
- `run_tests.sh` shell wrapper
- GitHub Actions CI runs tests on every push
- Basic structure: `tests/fixtures/<category>/<test>/inputs/*.in.txt` + `expected/*.out.txt`

#### Phase 2: File-Based I/O Refactor (Jan 25) — `59e8dea`
- Major rewrite (52 files, 1179 insertions)
- Tests use `INPUT.TXT` → COBOL binary → `OUTPUT.TXT` pattern
- Unified diff generation for failures (color-coded)
- Test discovery made recursive

#### Phase 3: Comments in Test Files (Mar 5) — `86e361d`
- Inline comments (`# comment`) and full-line comments supported in `.in.txt` files
- Escaped hashes (`\#`) for literal `#` in input
- Made test files self-documenting:
  ```
  1        # Login
  alice    # Username
  Alice1!  # Password
  4        # Find someone you know
  ```

#### Phase 4: Dump & Debug Mode (Mar 5) — `7634ef8`
- `--dump-output` flag writes actual output to `.actual.out.txt` for debugging
- `--dump-only` mode skips comparison entirely

#### Phase 5: Packaging System (Feb 19 → Mar 12) — `83e5edf`, then expanded in `7152c25`
- `package_tests.py` creates submission-ready zip files
- Two zips per test: Input ZIP + Output ZIP
- Fully expands all macros and seed directives for submission

#### Phase 6: Live Interactive CLI (Mar 12) — `378018a`
- `live_cli.py` — REPL for debugging COBOL program interactively
- Commands: `:help`, `:dump`, `:show`, `:undo`, `:clear`, `:rerun`, `:quit`
- Replays full transcript after each input, shows latest output
- Saves session to `.live_session.input.txt`

#### What to Show on Slides
- Before/after comparison: raw test file vs. commented/macro'd test file
- The test runner terminal output (color-coded pass/fail with diffs)
- The live CLI in action (screenshot or animation)
- Stats: from 18 tests (Epic 1) → 150+ tests (Epic 9)

### Milestone 4: Epic 4 — Connection Requests (Feb 19)

**Slide Group: 1–2 slides**

#### What Was Built

- **Send Connection Request** — From main menu, send request to another user by name
- **View Pending Requests** — See incoming connection requests
- **Duplicate Prevention** — Cannot re-request to same user or already-connected user
- **New Data File** — `PENDING.DAT` for storing pending requests
- **Menu Expansion** — Main menu grows from 4 options to 7

#### Key Commits

| Hash | Date | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `cab991c` | ~Feb 15 | Add Epic #4 requirements PDF |
| `d001172` | ~Feb 15 | WIP: Start connection request implementation |
| `d8ed330` | ~Feb 17 | Add connection request implementation + test runner updates |
| `6d52def` | ~Feb 17 | Extend connection request to send and view requests |
| `781c8d5` | ~Feb 18 | Update all test fixtures for Epic 4 menu changes (7-option menu) |
| `45b408e` | Feb 19 | **Merge PR #13** — Connection requests into main (156 files, 4565 insertions) |

#### Architectural Note
- New copybooks: `SENDREQ_SRC.cpy` (135 lines), `VIEWREQ_SRC.cpy` (75 lines)
- `main.cob` grows by ~191 lines
- **All existing test fixtures had to be updated** for the new 7-option menu — this pain point motivates the macro system

#### Testing Note
- 100+ test fixtures added/updated
- Connection request test categories: send success, duplicate prevention, non-existent user, already connected, persistence across sessions
- Seed user macros (`@seed_user`) first introduced here in test branches — `d360be2`

---

### Milestone 5: Epic 5 — Accept/Reject Connections & Network (Mar 5)

**Slide Group: 1–2 slides**

#### What Was Built

- **Accept Connection Request** — Bidirectional confirmation creates `CONNECTIONS.DAT` entry
- **Reject Connection Request** — Removes pending request, no connection created
- **View My Network** — Display all established connections
- **New Data Files** — `CONNECTIONS.DAT` for confirmed connections
- **Input Pushback Mechanism** — Novel pattern where `VIEWREQ` can "push back" a menu read (stored in `WS-INPUT-PUSHBACK-LINE`, checked by `8100-READ-INPUT`)

#### Key Commits

| Hash | Date | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `75d73d4` | ~Feb 25 | Epic #5 requirements PDF |
| `c78aa23` | ~Mar 1 | Complete Epic 5 network features |
| `116f51a` | ~Mar 3 | Accept/reject requests, remove from pending after processing |
| `10b4050` | Mar 5 | **Merge PR #18** — Epic 5 into main (218 files, 6644 insertions — largest single merge) |

#### Testing Highlight
- `TEST_RUNNER_GUIDE.md` (226 lines) created — comprehensive documentation for the team on how to write and run tests
- 80+ test fixtures for accept/reject/network scenarios
- Multi-part tests introduced: `accept_single_part_1.in.txt` → `accept_single_part_2.in.txt` (tests persistence across program runs)

---

### Interlude B: Macros, Seed Directives & Packaging (Mar 5 – Mar 25)

**Slide Group: 2–3 slides — ANOTHER MAJOR DIFFERENTIATOR**

> *"Every time the menu changed, we had to update 100+ test files. There had to be a better way."*

This interlude covers three innovations that transformed the test infrastructure:

#### 1. Output Macros — `{{MACRO}}` Expansion

**Problem:** The main menu text appears in nearly every expected output file. When the menu changed (from 4 to 7 to 9 options), hundreds of `.out.txt` files needed manual updates.

**Solution:** `menus.yml` defines reusable output blocks:
```yaml
MAIN_MENU: |
  1. Create/Edit My Profile
  2. View My Profile
  3. Search for a job
  4. Find someone you know
  5. View Pending Connection Requests
  6. Learn a New Skill
  7. View My Network
  8. Messages
  9. Logout
  Enter your choice:
```

Expected output files use `{{MAIN_MENU}}` — expanded at test time. Menu changes require updating ONE file.

**Key commit:** `b4634ca` — Implement macro-driven test outputs (part of Epic 6 PR)
**Key file:** `tests/macro_defs/menus.yml` (156 lines, ~30 macros)

**Macros include:** `{{WELCOME_BANNER}}`, `{{LOGIN_SCREEN}}`, `{{CREATE_ACCOUNT_HEADER}}`, `{{PASSWORD_PROMPT}}`, `{{MAIN_MENU}}`, `{{PROFILE_EDIT_HEADER}}`, `{{JOB_MENU}}`, `{{MESSAGES_MENU}}`, and many more.

#### 2. Seed Directives — `@seed_user`, `@seed_connection`, `@seed_message`

**Problem:** Testing connection features requires creating 2+ accounts first. Every test file starts with 30+ lines of account creation keypresses.

**Solution:** Declarative directives at the top of `.in.txt`:
```
@seed_user username=alice password=Alice1! first_name=Alice last_name=Smith \
  university=USF major=CS grad_year=2027
@seed_user username=bob password=Bob123! first_name=Bob last_name=Jones \
  university=USF major=IT grad_year=2026
@seed_connection user_a=alice user_b=bob

# Actual test starts here — Alice views messages
1        # Login
alice    # Username
Alice1!  # Password
8        # Messages menu
2        # View My Messages
```

The `PersistenceManager` writes directly to `.DAT` files before execution — no interactive account creation needed.

**Key commits:**
- `d360be2` — First seed user macros for test input files (Epic 5)
- `b4d45a3` — Full migration of all tests to `@seed_user` directives (30 commits across all categories)
- `cda4374` — Add `@seed_connection` and `@seed_message` directives (Epic 9)

**Key files:**
- `tests/incollege_tests/preprocessing.py` — Parses seed directives, strips comments
- `tests/incollege_tests/persistence.py` — Writes `.DAT` files with correct fixed-width formats
- `tests/incollege_tests/constants.py` — Field width definitions matching COBOL record layouts
- `tests/incollege_tests/models.py` — `SeedUserMacro`, `SeedConnection`, `SeedMessage` dataclasses

#### 3. Syntax Highlighting for Test Files

**Problem:** Test fixture files are plain text — hard to read and edit.

**Solution:** VS Code language configuration for `.in.txt` and `.out.txt` files:
- `.in.txt` mapped to `shellscript` → `#` comments render with theme comment color
- Custom language `incollege-expected-output` for `.out.txt` with syntax highlighting

**Key commit:** `ac216ae` — Add syntax highlighting and language configuration for InCollege Expected Output

#### What to Show on Slides
- Side-by-side: raw test file (30 lines of setup) vs. seed-directive version (3 lines of setup)
- The macro expansion pipeline (diagram)
- The `menus.yml` file snippet
- VS Code screenshot with syntax highlighting

- `.claude/agents/cobol-master.md` added — AI agent specialized in COBOL programming
- `.claude/agents/test-writer.md` added — AI agent for generating test fixtures

#### Testing Note
- 40+ test fixtures covering: browse list, job details, apply, duplicate application, report generation, no jobs available, invalid selections
- Tests now extensively use `@seed_user` directives + `{{MACRO}}` output expansion

### Interlude C: The Great Modularization (Apr 2)

**Slide Group: 1–2 slides**

> *"main.cob was approaching 2000 lines. It was time to break it apart."*

This interlude covers the massive refactor that happened as part of the Epic 8 PR.

#### What Happened

The monolithic `main.cob` was decomposed into **27 copybooks**:

**Working Storage (7 copybooks):**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `WS-CONSTANTS.cpy` | Named constants (max accounts=5, max jobs=25, file status codes) |
| `WS-IO-CONTROL.cpy` | Menu choices, flags, file status variables, input pushback |
| `WS-ACCOUNTS.cpy` | In-memory accounts table (5 slots) |
| `WS-PROFILES.cpy` | User profiles, experience, education arrays |
| `WS-CONNECTIONS.cpy` | Pending requests + established connections tables |
| `WS-JOBS.cpy` | Job postings + application counters |
| `WS-MESSAGES.cpy` | Message state, next-ID counter |

**Procedure (13+ copybooks):**
| File | Lines | Paragraphs |
|------|-------|------------|
| `DATALOAD.cpy` | 296 | 1100–1162, 9200–9275 (load all .DAT files) |
| `AUTH.cpy` | 306 | 3000–4600 (login, create account, password validation) |
| `PROFILE.cpy` | 751 | 7000–7100 (create/edit/view profiles) |
| `SEARCH.cpy` | — | 5300 (job search menu) |
| `JOBS.cpy` | 242 | 5350 (job posting/management) |
| `BROWSEJOBS.cpy` | 189 | Browse job listings |
| `APPLYJOB.cpy` | 156 | Apply to jobs |
| `VIEWAPPS.cpy` | — | Application report |
| `SENDMESSAGE.cpy` | 285 | 7800–7830 (send message flow) |
| `VIEWMESSAGE.cpy` | — | 7840–7841 (view messages) |
| `CONNMGMT.cpy` | — | Connection management |
| `NETWORK.cpy` | — | 7700 (view network list) |
| `SENDREQ.cpy` | 170 | Send connection requests |
| `VIEWREQ.cpy` | 249 | View/accept/reject pending requests |
| `SKILLS.cpy` | — | 6000 (skills menu) |
| `JOBSIO.cpy` | — | Job file I/O operations |
| `CONNWRITE.cpy` | — | Write connections to file |

**After the refactor, `main.cob` dropped to ~388 lines** — purely orchestration:
- Program identification
- File definitions
- `COPY` statements for all working storage
- Main control flow (0000, 1000, 2000, 5000)
- I/O utilities (8000, 8100)
- Termination (9000)
- `COPY` statements for all procedure copybooks

#### Key Commits
- `970e33c` — Extract named constants into `WS-CONSTANTS.cpy`
- `fd827d8` — Extract working storage into 6 domain copybooks
- `054268e` — Extract procedure paragraphs into 8 feature copybooks
- `a408a31` — Update COPY statements to remove `_SRC` suffix
- `063e92e` — Merge refactor/modularize branch

#### What to Show on Slides
- Before: `main.cob` at ~1950 lines (one giant file)
- After: `main.cob` at ~388 lines + 27 copybooks
- Diagram showing the copybook dependency tree
- The paragraph numbering convention: `XYYY` where X=domain, YYY=function

## Part C — Epic 9 Deep Dive: View Messages

**Slide Group: 3–4 slides — THE FEATURED EPIC**

> This is the only section where we focus on a single epic in detail, breaking it down into stories and subtasks as discussed in Part A.

### Epic 9 Overview

**Epic:** Messaging — View Messages
**Goal:** Enable users to view received messages in chronological order with proper sender attribution and recipient isolation.

### Story Breakdown

#### Story 1: View My Messages (Basic)
**As a user, I want to view messages sent to me so that I can read communications from my connections.**

**Subtasks:**
1. Add paragraph `7840-VIEW-MESSAGES` to handle the "View My Messages" flow
2. Open `MESSAGES.DAT` and scan for records where recipient = logged-in user
3. Display each matching message with: sender, message body, timestamp
4. Handle empty inbox: "You have no messages at this time."
5. Handle missing `MESSAGES.DAT` file gracefully (file status 35)

**Implementation Details:**
- File: `src/VIEWMESSAGE.cpy`
- Paragraphs: `7840-VIEW-MESSAGES`, `7841-DISPLAY-MESSAGES`
- Pattern: Open file → read sequentially → filter by recipient → display → close
- Uses `WS-MSG-FOUND` flag (renamed from `WS-VIEW-MSG-FOUND` per JIRA spec — commit `95dba46`)

**Key commits:**
| Hash | Date | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `6424661` | ~Apr 5 | Implement `7840-VIEW-MESSAGES` for Epic 9 Story 1 |
| `95dba46` | ~Apr 5 | Rename `WS-VIEW-MSG-FOUND` to `WS-MSG-FOUND` per JIRA spec |
| `de43d92` | ~Apr 6 | Implement message display formatting with header/footer |
| `767d896` | ~Apr 7 | Update main.cob header comments and section documentation |

#### Story 2: Message Ordering & Formatting
**As a user, I want messages displayed in chronological order (oldest first) with clear formatting.**

**Subtasks:**
1. Messages displayed oldest-first (natural file order since appended chronologically)
2. Each message formatted with header separator, sender line, content line, timestamp line
3. Footer separator after all messages
4. Message count or summary

#### Story 3: Recipient Isolation
**As a user, I want to only see messages addressed to me, not other users' messages.**

**Subtasks:**
1. Filter `MESSAGES.DAT` records by `MSG-RECIPIENT = WS-CURRENT-USER`
2. Skip records where recipient doesn't match
3. Verify isolation across multiple users in test fixtures

#### Story 4: Persistence & Edge Cases
**As a user, I want messages to persist and be viewable across sessions.**

**Subtasks:**
1. Messages survive program restart
2. New messages from other sessions appear on next view
3. Handle concurrent message state (send + view in same session)

### Test Infrastructure Additions for Epic 9

The Epic 9 PR introduced significant test infrastructure improvements:

#### New Seed Directive: `@seed_message`
```
@seed_message sender=alice recipient=bob content="Hello Bob!" timestamp="2026-04-10 14:30:00"
```

**Implementation:** `tests/incollege_tests/preprocessing.py` — parses `@seed_message`, `tests/incollege_tests/persistence.py` — writes to `MESSAGES.DAT` with correct fixed-width format.

#### New Seed Directive: `@seed_connection`
```
@seed_connection user_a=alice user_b=bob
```
Writes bidirectional connection records directly to `CONNECTIONS.DAT`.

#### Test Fixtures Created (60+ files)
Located in `tests/fixtures/view_message/`:

| Test Category | What It Verifies |
|--------------|------------------|
| Empty inbox | "You have no messages" when no messages for user |
| Single message | One message displays correctly with sender/content/timestamp |
| Multiple messages (same sender) | Multiple messages from one person |
| Multiple messages (different senders) | Messages from different connections |
| Recipient isolation | User A cannot see User B's messages |
| Persistence across restarts | Messages survive program exit/restart |
| Send and view in same session | Send a message, then view it in same run |
| No MESSAGES.DAT file | Graceful handling when file doesn't exist |
| Message ordering | Oldest-first chronological display |

### Epic 9 Final Merge

## Part D — Architecture & Design Patterns

**Slide Group: 2–3 slides**

### 1. Data Architecture

Seven persistent `.DAT` files, all fixed-width sequential:

| File | Record Size | Max Records | Purpose |
|------|------------|-------------|---------|
| `ACCOUNTS.DAT` | 32 bytes | 5 | Username (20) + Password (12) |
| `PROFILES.DAT` | 1,206 bytes | 5 | Full profile with experience/education |
| `PENDING.DAT` | ~60 bytes | 50 | Pending connection requests |
| `CONNECTIONS.DAT` | 40 bytes | 50 | Established connections (bidirectional) |
| `JOBS.DAT` | ~500 bytes | 25 | Job postings with all fields |
| `APPLICATIONS.DAT` | ~150 bytes | 25 | User job applications |
| `MESSAGES.DAT` | 265 bytes | unlimited | All messages with timestamps |

### 2. Program Flow Pattern

Every interaction follows the same pattern:
1. **Load** all `.DAT` files into in-memory tables at startup (`DATALOAD.cpy`)
2. **Process** user input through menu-driven paragraph calls
3. **Validate** at every boundary (password rules, field lengths, user existence, connection status)
4. **Persist** changes to `.DAT` files immediately after state changes
5. **Display** all output through `8000-WRITE-OUTPUT` (dual: screen + `OUTPUT.TXT`)
6. **Read** all input through `8100-READ-INPUT` (from `INPUT.TXT`, with pushback support)

### 3. Testing Pipeline

│  4. Generate unified diff on fail  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
   PASS ✓ or FAIL ✗ (with diff)
```

### 4. Key COBOL Patterns Worth Highlighting

- **Input Pushback** (`WS-INPUT-PUSHBACK-LINE`) — A mini lookahead buffer; `VIEWREQ` reads a line, decides it belongs to the caller, pushes it back. `8100-READ-INPUT` checks the pushback flag before reading the file.
- **Recursive Read Loops** — `PERFORM <paragraph>` from within that paragraph, until EOF. Classic COBOL pattern for sequential file reading.
- **In-Memory Tables with OCCURS** — Fixed-size arrays (5 accounts, 50 connections, 25 jobs) with counters. Linear search via `PERFORM VARYING`.
- **Dual I/O Channel** — Every `DISPLAY` goes to both the screen and `OUTPUT.TXT` via `8000-WRITE-OUTPUT`. Every `ACCEPT` comes from `INPUT.TXT` via `8100-READ-INPUT`. This enables fully automated testing.
- **File Status Checking** — Every file operation checks `WS-<FILE>-STATUS` against `WS-CONST-FS-OK` (00), `WS-CONST-FS-EOF` (10), `WS-CONST-FS-NOT-FOUND` (35). Graceful handling of missing files.

### The Story Arc (for the presenter to internalize)

> We started with a blank COBOL file and a Dockerfile. By week 2, we had authentication and a test runner. By week 4, we had profiles, search, and 50+ tests. The menu kept growing — from 4 options to 7 to 9 — and every change broke dozens of test files. So we built macros. Then seed directives. Then a packaging system. Then a live debugging CLI. Meanwhile, the codebase grew from one 500-line file to 28 modular copybooks. By the end, we had a full LinkedIn-like networking platform with 150+ automated tests, a COBOL program that handles authentication, profiles, connections, jobs, and messaging — all built in 11 weeks by a team of five who rotated roles every sprint.
